# machine-learning-algorithms
Contains implementations of the core machine learning algorithms.

The implementations of the following classic ML algorithms imitate scikit-learn's API:
- LinearRegression
- LogisticRegression
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- RandomForestClassifier
- SVC (support vector classifier)

Currently, the repository also contains implementations of several types of neural network layers and one  neural network model, all inspired by the Keras API:
- Activation layer
- BatchNormalization layer
- Conv2D layer
- Dense layer
- Flatten layer
- Sequential model

The repository currently supports stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam optimizers. In terms of loss functions, the choice is between cross-entropy and mean squared loss.

Please note that I am still learning and am by no means a professional practitioner. I am in the process of learning the details of ML/DL algorithms and architectures, and it is very likely that some of the implementations may not be entirely correct or bug-free.
